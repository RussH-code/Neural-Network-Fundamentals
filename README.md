# Neural-Network-Fundamentals

Neural networks are core in deep learning. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes that resemble neurons in human brain. In this notebook, we explore a python library `tensorflow` to implement neural networks. This notebook is for the coding part of neural network only. For mathematical explanation on how neural networks work under the hood, there are some great resources for you to review.
